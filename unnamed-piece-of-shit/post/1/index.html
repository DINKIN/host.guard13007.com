		<h1>Net Neutrality Debate</h1>
		<p>This is a clip cut from Linux Outlaws episode 349, which in turn was cut from an episode of No Agenda. I feel it is very important to have more discussion on the issue because there is a lot of ignorance and mis-information out there, including perhaps some of what is discussed here. <a href="mp3/Net%20Neutrality%20Debate.mp3">listen</a></p>
