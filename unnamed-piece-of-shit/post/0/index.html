		<h1>No Making Money From Minecraft?</h1>
		<p>Minecraft is changing its EULA to stop you making money from Minecraft. <a href="mp3/No%20Making%20Money%20From%20Minecraft.mp3">listen</a></p>

		<p>Post publishing edit: A good modding friend of mine has talked to me about the subject, and says this is nothing new, and intended only to spot server admins doing things like selling in-game items that are part of the default Minecraft experience. The developers are aware there is a problem with the vagueness of the EULA, and are trying to get it worked out, but basically you really shouldn't be worried about this, other than about stopping the hackers DDoS'ing the authenication servers and keeping us from enjoying our game.</p>
