## For my plane reviews, the background mods I typically use are:

- Active Texture Management (texture compression, less memory usage)
- Better Buoyancy (water acts more like water)
- CollisionFX (pretty sparks)
- Destruction Effects (pretty explosions and fires and smoke)
- GHud (gives me a HUD on my keyboard)
- HyperEdit (in case I need to move a plane to another planet for testing)
- Improved Chase Camera (follows velocity vector instead of vessel direction)
- KerbinSide (bunch of stuff on Kerbin to launch from / land at / fly by)
- Kerbal Konstructs (allows KerbinSide to work)
- Smoke Screen (? I guess smoke effects of some kind xD)
- Landing Height (adjusts altitude meter to be based on lowest part of vessel)
- Planet Shine (makes planets reflect sunlight)
- Show All Fuels (shows all fuels an engine is using on the staging bar)
- Smart Stage (can help you plan staging / see how a rocket will perform..dunno why I chose it for plane reviews actually)
- Trajectories (plots a trajectory taking into account drag to help you plan landings, may not be working)
