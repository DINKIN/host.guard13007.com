Random story idea I had while watching a movie named after dragons and having
nothing at all to do with dragons other than a brief mention at  the beginning
and at the end where they seemed more like unruly pests than anything else.

---

Everything points to the story being about dragons being evil and raised against
us. Turns out the humans fighting them are the great rising evil and the dragons
are fighting just to survive.

As all story ideas hosted here if I posted more here, this idea is free to steal
(like I could stop you anyhow), just let me know if you do cause I'd like to
read what you come up with.
